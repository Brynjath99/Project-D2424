Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are commonly used for Image classification. In this
paper, we propose numerous methods to build and train a modern ConvNet architecture from
scratch. Since the deeper neural networks are more diï¬€icult to train, for this, we extend the
VGG networks to look more like Residual Network (ResNet) and show that these networks have
low complexity and are easier to optimize.
The approaches used in our study includes Weight Decay, Dropout, Data Augmentation,
Standardization, Batch Normalization, Cosine Annealing, making VGGs look like ResNet, ex-
tensive data augmentation and exploring various Normalization techniques. In this paper, we
demonstrate results at 89.16 % by empirically examining CIFAR-10 data. Moreover, the exper-
iments used in the paper are implemented using Tensorflow deep learning packages.
